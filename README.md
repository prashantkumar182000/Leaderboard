# üöó Formula One Leaderboard Application (v2) üèÅ [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


## Overview
The **Formula One Leaderboard Application** is a cutting-edge, responsive leaderboard built using **ReactJS**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux**. Designed with efficiency, performance, and user experience in mind, this application showcases advanced features like a **non-stop looping F1 racing video footer**, **real-time validation**, and **smooth animations**. 

Version 2 represents a major leap forward in design, functionality, and performance optimization. Leveraging **AI-assisted development**, I saved over **20+ hours** of manual coding, ensuring rapid delivery without compromising quality. The app is hosted on **Netlify**, with assets optimized via **CDNs** for blazing-fast load times.

## Key Features

### **‚ú® Version 2 Highlights**
- **Non-Stop Looping Video Footer**: Replaced static image sliders with a high-performance, immersive F1 racing video. Hosted on **ImageKit.io** for optimal loading speeds.
- **Modernized UI**: Introduced gradient backgrounds, accent borders, and sleek animations that align perfectly with the F1 racing theme.
- **Improved Input Structure**: Enhanced the "Add Score" popup with floating labels, icons, and real-time validation for a seamless user experience.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Reduced video size by **50%** (from 23 MB to 10 MB) using **HandBrake/FFmpeg** compression.
  - Implemented **lazy loading** for the video to improve initial page load times.
  - Hosted all static assets on a CDN for faster delivery.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across all devices‚Äîdesktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Efficient State Management**: Used **Redux** for seamless state updates and animations, ensuring smooth transitions when adding new scores.

### **üåü Version 1 Features**
- **Responsive Design**: The leaderboard dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring the top 10 scores are always visible.
- **Auto-Scrolling Footer**: A visually engaging auto-scrolling image footer enhanced user experience.
- **Add Score Popup**: Users could add new scores with fields for **Username** and **Score** formatted as `MM:SS:MS`.
- **Smooth Animation**: New scores were smoothly animated into the leaderboard if they ranked within the top 10.
- **Pure CSS Animations**: No external libraries were used, keeping the app lightweight and efficient.
- **Fixed Header and Footer**: Ensured consistent sizing across all devices.

## Efficiency and Performance üöÄ

### **AI-Assisted Development**
I leveraged **AI tools** such as **GitHub Copilot** and **ChatGPT** to accelerate development, reduce boilerplate code, and implement industry best practices. These tools helped me save **over 20 hours** of manual coding by:
- Automating repetitive tasks like writing utility functions and optimizing CSS animations.
- Generating optimized code snippets for Redux state management and TypeScript interfaces.
- Streamlining debugging and testing processes.

This AI-driven approach allowed me to focus on delivering high-quality features while maintaining a fast-paced development cycle.

### **Performance Improvements**
- **Video Compression**: Reduced the video file size by **50%** (from 23 MB to 10 MB) using modern codecs and compression tools like **HandBrake** and **FFmpeg**.
- **CDN Hosting**: All static assets, including the video and images, are hosted on **ImageKit.io**, ensuring faster load times and better scalability.
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented lazy loading for the video to defer loading until it‚Äôs needed, significantly improving initial page load times.
- **Code Splitting**: Optimized the React app by splitting large components into smaller chunks, reducing the initial bundle size.
